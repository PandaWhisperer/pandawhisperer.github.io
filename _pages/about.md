Christoph discovered his passion for computers at a young age, when his dad bought his first PC in 1994. It was a Intel 386 processor with 4 Megabytes of RAM and a whopping 250 MB hard drive.

After annoying his parents by spending way too much times playing games such as [Bushbuck: Global Treasure Hunter](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/bush-buck-global-treasure-hunter-13v) and [Commander Keen 4: Secret of the Oracle](http://www.myabandonware.com/game/commander-keen-4-secret-of-the-oracle-148), he started getting curious about how to actually make the computer do whatever he wanted. After taking a weekend programming course for teenagers, he bought his first compiler, [Turbo Pascal 6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), which came on 4 floppy disks as a bonus to a programming book. And that’s how the journey started.

After finishing university in [Germany](http://www.uni-ulm.de/en) and [Los Angeles](http://www.usc.edu/) with a degree in Economathematics and Mathematical Finance, he started working full-time as a software developer. First with Java and the [Spring Framework](http://spring.io/), then with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and nowadays with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) on the backend, and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) or [Polymer Web Components](http://www.polymer-project.org/) on the frontend.
