> Programming languages shape the way their users thinkâ€”which helps explain how tech startups work and why they are able to reinvent themselves.

Excellent article on Technology Review about how the choice of their primary programming language has an influence not just on the product they built, but also on company culture as a whole.

Aside from some obligatory PHP-bashing, we learn that Wikipedia's principal engineer *hates* PHP (it was largely responsible for not having a mobile version of their site until 2008), the idea for [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org)  came from a science fiction novel, and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) powers not just at least 2% of Wall Street's computerized trading, but also the type checking system in [Facebook's Hack](http://hacklang.org/) language.

The only gripe I have with the article is that it's much too short.
