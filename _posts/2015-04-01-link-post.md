Another excellent article from my [fellow Panda][ps] [Giles Bowkett][giles]. Instead of the usual corny April Fool's jokes, he remixes an older post by the venerable Paul Graham, who originally wrote it about Python.

As always with Giles's post, it contains a veritable treasure trove of excellent links, such as [this post on remote work][atw] by Jeff Atwood (of Coding Horror and Discourse fame), which is one of the best and most thorough pieces on remote work I have read.
