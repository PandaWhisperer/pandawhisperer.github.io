title: "CoffeeScript: entering multiple lines in the REPL"

Finally found a solution to one of my most annoying complaints about the CoffeeScript REPL: turns out you can write code spanning multiple lines after all!

Just press `Ctrl+V` at the prompt to turn on multiline mode.

Thanks to Alex on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14540163/288395) for this.
