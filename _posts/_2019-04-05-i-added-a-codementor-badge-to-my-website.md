title: "I added a CodeMentor badge to my website"
---
<p>That was a LOT more work than I'd like to admit. Seriously, it took me several hours. And I'll explain why. But first, let's see the result:</p><figure data-orig-width="738" data-orig-height="838" class="tmblr-full"><img src="images/posts/3ef1ab2a01336f2ba952aa87c65cad60104ad53ebbd24f27c4252a04b41f442b.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="738" data-orig-height="838"></figure><p><a href="https://www.breakdiving.io/photos/122"></a></p><p>Sweet, isn't it? Now, let me walk you through the process of creating it.</p><!-- more --><p>First of all, I needed a CodeWars icon in font format. Why is that, you ask? Well, that's how the theme I'm using on my website works. Each of the badges is a link, which has the icon inserted into it from a custom font. I tried using an image, but it wouldn't work. It would just break the layout, and the highlighting didn't work either (note how the icons subtly change color when they are hovered over).</p><h2>Iconoclastic</h2><p>So, where do I get a font that includes a CodeWars icon? The website isn't nearly as popular as Google, Github, or Facebook, so obviously, no icon was included in the theme. But looking at how the theme implemented the icons, I found an interesting lead: the font it was using was called "Fontello". <a href="http://fontello.com/">The Fontello website</a> explained that it isn't really a fixed font set (like <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">FontAwesome</a>), but rather, a custom font generator, that lets you upload your own icons and turn them into a webfont. Neat!</p><p>Okay, so I now I knew how I could make a font with that icon in it, but where do I get the icon? The Fontello website only accepts SVG files. But the site favicon is an ICO file. SVG is a vector file format, but ICO is a pixel-based format. Not helpful. Thankfully, I had the idea to check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/PandaWhisperer/badges/">“badge” feature on Codewars</a>. Actually, that’s where I started this whole journey – I wanted to add a badge to my website, but I didn’t like any of the formats they provided, because they wouldn’t look clean in my theme.</p><p>If you go to your user profile and add "/badges" to the end of the URL, you’ll see a collection of badges that you can add to your website. And those happen to be in SVG format, AND they include the CodeWars logo!<br></p><figure data-orig-width="1994" data-orig-height="1198" class="tmblr-full"><img src="images/posts/03809fe1ea7c3de6372ca9efae2424853a9ee819449b6defdc9a215ab3abd238.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1994" data-orig-height="1198"></figure><h2>Don’t badger me, bro!</h2><p><a href="https://www.breakdiving.io/photos/120"></a></p><p>Alright, but the problem is, it's not just the logo. There's a bunch of other stuff that I can't use! How do I get rid of that?</p><p>Well, that's when I remembered that SVG files are just plain text files, like HTML. In fact, SVG has a very similar syntax to HTML, and you can actually inspect SVG files using Chrome's web inspector, which helpfully even highlights the corresponding elements in the image.</p><figure data-orig-width="1838" data-orig-height="1416" class="tmblr-full"><img src="images/posts/50c9e1c9d36415aba7d2b396199f6dc3e4ffdd76b7198000e03066d73d139d2b.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1838" data-orig-height="1416"></figure><p><a href="https://www.breakdiving.io/photos/121"></a></p><p>From here, I could see that the icon was just a single &lt;path&gt; element. Good. I could download this file, and remove all the other extraneous stuff, and then I'd only be left with the logo itself. So far so good. But the logo is still in a square box, and being created from only a single path, I could not easily remove that. That's when I had to dive deeper. Time to learn us some SVG!</p><p>Okay, okay, I'm only kidding. Well... sort of. After looking up the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths">Paths Tutorial on MDN</a>, I quickly gave up on the idea of just editing this by hand, even with Atom's awesome SVG previewer. I needed a graphical editor. A quick Google search led me to&nbsp;<a href="https://macsvg.org">MacSVG</a>, which is both free AND gives you full control over the source code, while still providing helpful tools to arrange things graphically.</p><p>I'll spare you a bunch of extremely detailed and complicated fiddling with this editor. Safe to say I spent about an hour or two just whipping the outer shape of the logo into a circle. In the process, I actually learned quite a bit about how SVG paths work, and the practical difference between Bezier curves and elliptical arcs. But eventually, I had my round Codewars logo, and I had it in SVG format!</p><figure data-orig-width="2262" data-orig-height="1652" class="tmblr-full"><img src="images/posts/bfa66b9bd201b00fa706ce71bc1d7cefb6cd1c560dca5665e07791268dc229c1.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="2262" data-orig-height="1652"></figure><p><a href="https://www.breakdiving.io/photos/119"></a></p><p>So, next, I uploaded this file to Fontello, downloaded my new font, and added it to my website theme. I'll spare you the details of another half hour or so of annoying fiddling, but in the end, it worked. Well, sorta. After reloading the site (which looked fine in the preview) in Chrome, all the other badges had disappeared, and only the CodeWars badge remained. But when I loaded the site in Safari, it looked fine, just as expected. I supposed I’ll try to fix this eventually, but after all that work, I needed a little break.</p>
