title: "ItsyCal"

A couple of years ago, when [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) first rolled out their new desktop, one of the things that immediately stood out to me was how closely it resembled MacOS X. It was, in fact, almost *too* close. But when I played around with it a bit, I immediately noticed where it was lacking polish compared to Apple — and where it had made improvements. 

One of the most useful features, too me, was its popup calendar: when you clicked the time in the task bar, a small calendar would pop up, showing the current month, like so:

<!-- more -->

If you do the same on a Mac, however, all you get is a context menu that lets you switch from digital to analog, and a shortcut to the Date & Time preference pane:

How useless! Ever since, I found myself wishing for this feature, hoping that Apple would at some point decide to add this to the OS. 

They did not.

So when I found out about [Shaun Inman's Day-O](http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2011/10/20/day_o_mac_menu_bar_clock), I was delighted. It was a tiny app whose only purpose was to replace the default clock with one that had a popup calendar. Unfortunately, no integration for appointments, but hey! it was free and it worked, so no complaints there.

I've used Day-O for a couple of years, until today, when I somehow stumbled upon [ItsyCal](http://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/). It does essentially the same, but the calendar is a little prettier, supports showing calendar weeks (if you're into that), AND it shows your upcoming appointments, straight from iCal. So today, I say thanks to Day-O for having me served so well all these years, and hello to ItsyCal. Let's hope it does its job just as well.

PS: of course, Day-O had [something else](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euc9MMRtuSg) going for it as well...
