[Glideroom](http://glideroom.com) is a multi-user web conferencing solution that lets you quickly create private chat rooms with audio and video and gives you a secure URL that you can easily share via email, text, or instant message.

It leverages WebRTC, which is built into most modern browsers, so there is no awkward plugin installation required. I wrote this together with one other developer at [Panda Strike](https://www.pandastrike.com) over the course of two months.
