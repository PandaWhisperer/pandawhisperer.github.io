[TweetMyJobs](http://www.tweetmyjobs.com) was a job search engine that used Twitter to send qualified job matches directly to your smartphone or Twitter-enabled device.

I worked on this project as part of my tenure at [Synctree](http://www.synctree.com), a Ruby on Rails consultancy based in Pasadena, California. It was built in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

TweetMyJobs was acquired by the [CareerArc group](https://www.careerarc.com/).
