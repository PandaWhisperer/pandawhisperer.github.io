[Farespotter](http://farespotter.net/) is a travel website, similar to [Kayak.com](http://kayak.com/), that lets you search for deals on flights, hotels, and rental cars anywhere in the US and abroad.

I worked on this site as part of my role at [Oversee.net](http://www.oversee.net). I was the principal developer for about 6 months.

This app is built in [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), using [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) as a datastore, [memcache](http://memcached.org/) for caching, and [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/) for deployment.
