List Metrics is an app I built during my time at [GoodData](http://www.gooddata.com), an enterprise business analytics company based in San Francisco, CA. This app lets you browse and view metrics defined within your GoodData projects, find unused metrics and delete them, and analyze how and where your metrics are used.

This app was built in 100% JavaScript, using the [Ember.js framework](http://emberjs.com/) and the [GoodData REST API](https://developer.gooddata.com/api) as backend.
