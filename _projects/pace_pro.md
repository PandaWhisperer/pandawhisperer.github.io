Pace Pro is a SaaS app for the remodeling industry. It seamlessly integrates all backoffice operations and customer relationship management into a single app, allowing users to track and manage the entire lifecycle of a customer, from acquisition to successfully delivered project.

In collaboration with the business owner, I planned, architected, and built the entire first MVP, which includes the first 4 stages of the customer lifecycle, appointment planning (with Google Calendar integration), user management, and a hiring / interview tracking system. The app is fully multi-tenant capable.
