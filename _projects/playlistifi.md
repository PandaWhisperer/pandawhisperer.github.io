[Playlistifi.me](http://playlistifi.me) is a web app for social music discovery that I am working on.
It allows you to create playlists based on Facebook groups that you are a member of, or subreddits that you follow.

I am the sole developer, designer, and project manager on this app. It is written completely in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), using the [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/) framework.
